=head1 NAME

Term::Completion::Multi - read one line of user input with multiple values

=head1 USAGE

  use Term::Completion::Multi;
  my $tc = Term::Completion::Multi->new(
    prompt  => "Enter your first names: ",
    choices => [ qw(Alice Bob Chris Dave Ellen Frank George Heidi Ida) ]
  );
  my @names = $tc->complete();
  print "You entered: @names\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Term::Completion::Multi is a derived class of L<Term::Complete>. It allows
to enter one line with multiple choices from a list of choices, delimited
by a configurable delimiter character (typically one space).
The return value of the C<complete()> method is the list of values.

See L<Term::Complete> for details.

=head2 Configuration

Term::Completion::Multi adds one additional configuration parameter,
namely "delim". The default is one space. You can change this to e.g.
a comma character if you prefer the user to separate the choices with a comma
instead of a space:

  my $tc = Term::Completion->new(
    delim => ',',
    ...

=head2 Validation

The input validation works very much like in L<Term::Completion>. Here
however the input is first split upon the delimiter character, and then
each item is validated. Consecutive delimiter characters are treated as one.
If any single validation fails, the entire input is cancelled. If all items
validate OK, then the return value is built by concatenating the items
returned from validation with the delimiter character.

If you don't like the above then you are free to write a class that is
derived from Term::Completion::Multi and overrides the C<validate> method.
