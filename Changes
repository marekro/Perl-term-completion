Revision history for Perl extension Term::Completion.

1.00 Mon Feb 24 2013
Wow - 4 years of silence... sorry for that...

Slight change in the API: the "validate" callback is now supposed to return
undef (the undefined value) in case the validation failed; this was required 
to allow "false" values (in the sense of Perl, like 0, '') as correct
return values (defined) of the validation callback.

A couple of minor bug fixes and improvements, tested with on a bunch of
platforms, in an attempt to increase portability:
- Windows / ActivePerl
- Windows / Cygwin
- Windows / SUA
- Linux
- Solaris

Fixed a few POD errors and added POD for T:C:Multi and :Path.

CPAN #83424: Bug in Term::Completion
- fixed deprecated goto (with Perl 5.12 and higher)

CPAN #77772: [wish] on-demand alternative to (automatic) help
- implemented propsal, thanks for the patch!

CPAN #77697: Warning 'Use of uninitialized value' when scrolling if input
             text is not matched
- applied patch, thanks a lot!
